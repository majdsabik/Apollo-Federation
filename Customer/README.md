# What's this?  

This is a simple NestJS app that uses Apollo GraphQL server to query Commercetools Customer object using Commercetools GraphQL.  
The intention behind it is to test [Apollo federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/ "Introduction to Apollo Federation").  
This is writted in the schema-first approach, but it can also be done in code-first approach.  
To start the app, simply run `npm install` and then `npm start:dev`.
